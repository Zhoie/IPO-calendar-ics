# ðŸ“ˆ IPO Calendar (.ics Generator)

This project automatically creates an **.ics** file that lists upcoming â€” and very recent â€” U.S. IPOs, using data from the [Finnhub API](https://finnhub.io/).  
The file is refreshed **twice daily** by GitHub Actions, so you can subscribe in any calendar app (Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) and never miss a new listing.
